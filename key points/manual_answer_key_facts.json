    "manual_answer": "When cleaning the interior surfaces of your vehicle, use a soft cloth dampened with a mixture of warm water and mild non-detergent cleaner, and test all cleaners on a concealed area before use. Avoid using solvents, alcohol-based gel products, bleach, citrus, naphtha, or silicone-based products as they can cause damage. Do not allow water, cleaners, or fabric to enter a seat belt mechanism, and avoid using solvents or soap on interior accent lights.

    "manual_answer": "The alert 'Air pressure in tires very low PULL OVER SAFELY' means that one or more of your vehicle's tires is extremely low or flat. The tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) has detected that the air pressure in one or more tires is significantly lower than the recommended cold tire pressure. You should pull over carefully as soon as possible and check for a flat tire in a safe location. If needed, you can request Tesla roadside assistance for options like mobile tire service, a loaner wheel, or towing. In non-emergency situations, visiting a local tire shop or scheduling service via the Tesla Mobile App is recommended. The alert will clear once the TPMS measures consistent tire pressure within 3 psi of the recommended cold pressure after driving a short distance.",
