    "question": "Why is it important to have proper grounding for a Wall Connector?",
    "manual_answer": "Proper grounding for a Wall Connector is crucial because it ensures safety and functionality. Without a ground connection, the Wall Connector may not charge the vehicle, as indicated by the alert for insufficient grounding. Proper grounding prevents current from leaking through unsafe paths, which could lead to ground faults or electrical hazards. It is important to have an electrician inspect the Wall Connector to ensure it is properly grounded at the circuit breaker or power distribution box, and that all connections are correctly made. This helps avoid potential safety risks and ensures the Wall Connector operates correctly.",

    "question": "What does the alert 'Schedule service to replace low voltage battery' mean?",
    "manual_answer": "The alert 'Schedule service to replace low voltage battery' indicates that the low voltage battery in your vehicle is showing degraded performance and needs to be replaced. Until the battery is replaced, vehicle software updates will not complete. It is recommended to have the battery replaced at your earliest convenience, either through the Tesla Mobile App or an independent service provider. If the battery does not have enough power to turn on your vehicle or open the doors, you should follow the jump-starting instructions. Additionally, if the low voltage battery is unable to support all vehicle features, it may lead to unexpected vehicle shutdowns or the inability to restart the vehicle. In such cases, it is crucial to schedule service immediately.",

    "question": "What are the potential consequences if I do not pull over safely when my vehicle is preparing to shut down?",
    "manual_answer": "If you do not pull over safely when your vehicle is preparing to shut down, the vehicle may shut down unexpectedly. This could result in the vehicle not being able to restart once parked. Additionally, the vehicle may lose all electrical power, which would disable many vehicle functions. In such a case, you can still use the manual door releases to exit the vehicle. It is crucial to pull over safely at your earliest opportunity to avoid these risks.",

    "question": "What should you do if the tire pressure alert appears in cold weather?",
    "manual_answer": "If the tire pressure alert appears in cold weather, you should add air to maintain the recommended cold tire pressure. This is because the air in your tires naturally contracts in cold weather, decreasing tire pressures. Even if the alert clears as you drive and the tires warm up, you should still refill the tires with air once they have cooled. The alert will clear once the Tire Pressure Monitoring System detects that each tire is inflated to the recommended cold pressure. If the alert persists for the same tire, have it inspected for a slow leak.",
